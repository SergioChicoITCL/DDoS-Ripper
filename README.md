# DDoS-Ripper

# What is a DDoS Attack?
A Distributable Denied-of-Service (DDOS) attack server that cuts off targets or surrounding infrastructure in a flood of Internet traffic

DDoS attacks achieve effectiveness using multiple compromised computer systems as a source of attack traffic. Search engines may include computers and other network resources such as IoT devices.
From a higher level, the DDOS attack is like an unexpected traffic jam stuck on a highway, preventing regular traffic from reaching its destination.

# How this script works
Two bots are configured in the python code, "http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=" and "http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=".
When executing this script, requests are sent to these bots to issue an action to the victim. 
Also, request from the host are sent to the victim.
This generates traffic from several sources to the victim.

Be careful, as using the default bots could get you into trouble with "w3" and "facebook".
To avoid trouble, create your own bots in your own servers and replace the default bots.

## NOTE (Please, make sure you have installed python 3 )
